## The J42Ki is a modified version of the tray mount J42K with an integrated controller and daughter board.

The board retains the J42K's bottom row compatibility. 

# PCB
PCB files have not yet been released. 

# Case
The case shown in the photo is a modified 3dp case from the original J42K designed by Glow. I am working on an updated case and hope to get it manufactured soon. Below is a render I created. ![Render](J42Ki_render.jpg)

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware very out of date.
