# J42Ki

Improved itegrated version of the board. More info can be found [here!](https://github.com/MakerJake01/MakerJakes-keyboards/tree/main/J42K/J42ki). 

# The mistake
I messed up the main pcb because one of the switch footprints was off of the 19.05x19.05 grid. I was able to fix the pcb with a drill and a ton of time. It has been fixed in later revisions of the pcb. 

# Pcb
There is only one pcb needed for this board. I ordered mine from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and the quailty is great.  

# Case
The top and bottom case files can be found [here](). I printed both of mine from PLA. The quality does not matter to much. Sometimes the tray mounting points can snap off. 

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware very out of date.
