## The J42K is a PM based tray mount 12u HHKB ortho hotswap keyboard. 

# The mistake
I messed up the main pcb because one of the switch footprints was off of the 19.05x19.05 grid. I was able to fix the pcb with a drill and a ton of time. 

# Pcb
The zip file can be found [here](). There is only one pcb needed for this board. I ordered mine from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and the quailty is great.  

# Case
The top and bottom case files can be found [here](). I printed both of mine from PLA. The quality does not matter to much. Sometimes the tray mounting points can snap off. 

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware is [here]().
