## The J47K is a gasket mount hotswap 47 key board with arrows, an oled, and a promicro. 



# Pcb
The zip file can be found [here](). There is only one pcb needed for this board. I ordered mine from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and the quailty is great.  

# Case
The top and bottom case files can be found [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/MakerJakes-keyboards/tree/main/J47K/Case). I printed both of mine from PLA. The quality does not matter to much. There needs to be enough space for the gaskets to fit in the case. My prints warped a bit which is not the best but it can work.

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware is [here]().
