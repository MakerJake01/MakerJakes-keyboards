# Naming scheme 
The way I name my keyboards is quite repetitive, for many it can be a point of confusion. 
![Glow](https://i.imgur.com/2NWn8AT.png) 
<br>Most of my keyboards follow this naming convention because I can't think of new names so I use this.
## Breaking down the name 
The name has one main part, the starting bit. They all have a J##K, the number is the number of keys in the build. This helps me differentiate boards with different layouts. 
## The Suffix
As many might have noticed there are many boards with the same layout. The suffix allows me to add a bit of info to the name and keep the projects apart. There is no real rule for what the suffix has to be. The *Mx* in *J46KcolMx* tells me that this board uses Mx switches. Others can now guess the name of the board just by looking at it.
