## The J46Kvan is a minivan sized mx hotswap 12u atmega328p based keyboard.

This pcb is designed to work with tray mount cases but some of the screw holes are hard to access with the switches in place. On the bottom row there is a choice of 2x1u or 1x2u for each side of the bottom row.This board was heavily ispired by the [romeo by coseyfannitutti](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/romeo) and [squashkb's Lesovoz](https://trashman.wiki/community/pcbs/lesovoz). It also uses [coseyfannitutti fork of USBasp](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/USBaspLoader/tree/atmega328p).
