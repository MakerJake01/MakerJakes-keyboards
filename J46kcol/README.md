## The J46Kcol is a hotswap PM based split unibody cherry spaced choc columnar stagger tray mount keyboard with perkey rgb backlighting.
### [Back to main list of boards](https://github.com/MakerJake01/MakerJakes-keyboards) 
The keyboard has a spacing of 19.05x19.05. If I remember it's stagger is based on the [Le Chiffre](https://github.com/tominabox1/Le-Chiffre-Keyboard) by [TJ](https://github.com/tominabox1). It has a fixed 2x2u bottom row, there are some holes in the pcb for choc stabs but I dont have a plate designed. 

# Pcb
The zip file can be found [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/MakerJakes-keyboards/tree/main/J46Kcol/Pcb). There is only one pcb needed for this board. I ordered mine from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and the quailty is great.  

# Case
The top and bottom case files can be found [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/MakerJakes-keyboards/tree/main/J46Kcol/Case). I printed both of mine from PLA. The quality does not matter to much. Sometimes the tray mounting points can snap off. 

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware is [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/makerjake/J46Kcol).
