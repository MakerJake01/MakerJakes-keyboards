## A split hotswap ortho pro micro based ortho keyboard with an encoder and per key lighting. 
The Trailmax is based on the Trailmix by [rain](https://github.com/rainkeebs). While the Trailmix has 5 cols of keys the Trailmax has 6. I also added perkey rgb lighting using sk6812mini-e leds. I used low profile EC12 encoder to keep the height down. There are also footprints for oleds. 

# Pcb
### The most recent version of the pcb has not been tested. Try at your own risk.
The zip file can be found [here](). There is only one pcb needed for this board. I ordered mine from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and the quailty is great.  

# Case
The top and bottom case files can be found [here](). I printed both of mine from PLA. The quality does not matter to much. Sometimes the tray mounting points can snap off. 

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware is [here]().
