## The J46Kx [Seeeduino Xiao](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-nRF52840-p-5201.html) based reversible 12u split ortho hotswap low profile keyboard. 

This board was designed after the release of the Xiao nRF52840 for use with ZMK. It uses bav70 diodes and has footprints for hot swap choc switches. The layout is a fixed 2x2u for the bars. There is an optional pad for an led.

# Pcb
The first version of the pcb was difficult to solder as the pads under the Xiao needed a hot air reflow station to solder them to the pcb. An updated but untested pcb has been created that uses a larger hole to solder to the pads. The board uses 3 contact jst connectors to allow for both - + and + - battery connectors to plug in (the center pin is for -). The pcb is reversible and can be found [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/MakerJakes-keyboards/tree/main/J46Kx/Gerber).

# Case
The right and left case files can be found [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/MakerJakes-keyboards/tree/main/J46Kx/Case). I printed both of mine from PLA.

# Firmware 
It runs [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/) and the exact firmware is [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/zmk-config).
