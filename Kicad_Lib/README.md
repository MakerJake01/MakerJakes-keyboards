# MakerJake's footprint library

Over the course of making these keyboards I have made some custom footprints for my keyboard. They range from silkscreen art to useable part footprints. 

In all provided footprints I will attempt to acknowledge the source of the footprint if modified.

The [*CUI_SJ1-3514*](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/cui-devices/SJ1-3514/738682) footprint is from digikey.

The *D_DO-35_SOD27* & *D_DO-123* are modified from default KiCad libraries. I am unsure as to why I modified them however I used them and thus are included in this.

The [*JST-SR-4*](https://github.com/ai03-2725/random-keyboard-parts.pretty) is from the aio3 library.

The [*Xiao*](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/#resourses) footprints are based on files from seeeduino but slightly modified for my uses. 

The [*SK6812-MINI-E*](https://github.com/keebio/Keebio-Parts.pretty/tree/master?tab=MIT-1-ov-file) footprint is from the keebio parts library and I modified it for use in reverse mounting.
