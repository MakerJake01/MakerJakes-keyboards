## The J46Key or tesseract is a Atmega328p based hotswap keyboard with all the parts at the top of the keyboard. 
The board uses a skeleton fr4 tray mount case with a reversible backplate. It uses a fixed 2x2u bottom row. This board was heavily ispired by the [romeo by coseyfannitutti](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/romeo). It also uses [coseyfannitutti fork of USBasp](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/USBaspLoader/tree/atmega328p).

# Pcb
I have not yet released the pcb files but, I ordered mine from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and the quailty is great. You need the main pcb a plate and a back plate and switch plate. I also realize now that my decoupling capacitor placement is no ideal.

# Case
The case is made of a plate and a backplate. There is a back piece that gives the board an angle. The back piece can be found [here](). I would like to add a acrylic cover to protect the parts more. 

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware is [here]().
