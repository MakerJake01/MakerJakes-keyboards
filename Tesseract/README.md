# Pcb
The zip file can be found [here](). There is only one pcb needed for this board. I ordered mine from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and the quailty is great.  

# Case
The top and bottom case files can be found [here](). I printed both of mine from PLA. The quality does not matter to much. Sometimes the tray mounting points can snap off. 

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware is [here]().
