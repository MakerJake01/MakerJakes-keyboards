## The J46Kbm is a hotswap bottom mount ortho keyboard.
This keyboard uses an integrated pcb and a UDB. It also has a fixed 2x2u layout.  

# Pcb
The zip file can be found [here](). There is only one pcb needed for this board. I ordered mine from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and the quailty is great.  

# Case
The case files can be found [here](). I printed it out of PLA. The quality does not matter to much. 

I am working on a cnc machined case. I have run into some design problems and protos can be costly.

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware is [here]().
