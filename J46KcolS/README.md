## The J46KcolS is a hotswap PM based split choc v1 columnar stagger tray mount with encoders.
 If I remember its' stagger is based on the [Le Chiffre](https://github.com/tominabox1/Le-Chiffre-Keyboard) by [TJ](https://github.com/tominabox1). It has a fixed 2x2u bottom row. It is mainly designed for bluetooth use but there is a TRRS footprint. It has a 3 pin JST connector to plug in a battery and there is a smd power switch. Both halves support encoders with a click. 

## Changes in V1.1
- Slightly recessed power switch to stop them from breaking when not in use 
- Added encoder traces

# Parts
