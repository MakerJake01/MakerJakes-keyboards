## The J0K is a EC12 compatible knob with an M2 set screw.

The EC12 encoder is an amazing low profile. They have successfully been manufactured.

The two files both work. The one called `EC12Knob_Rect.step` has an extra internal feature to lock with the encoder. `EC12Knob.step` lacks this feature and is more compatible with a lathe based workflow.

Use the file `KnobThreads.pdf` to indicate to the manufacturer where and what threads to use.
