## The J46KcolMx is a hotswap PM based split unibody Mx columnar stagger bottom mount with an oled.
 If I remember its' stagger is based on the [Le Chiffre](https://github.com/tominabox1/Le-Chiffre-Keyboard) by [TJ](https://github.com/tominabox1). It has a fixed 2x2u bottom row. There is also a spot for an oled. 

# Pcb
The zip file can be found [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/MakerJakes-keyboards/tree/main/J46KcolMx/Pcb). There is only one pcb needed for this board. I ordered mine from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and the quailty is great.  

# Case
The top and bottom case files can be found [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/MakerJakes-keyboards/tree/main/J46KcolMx/Case). I printed both of mine from PLA. The quality does not matter to much. Sometimes the tray mounting points can snap off. 

# Firmware 
It runs [QMK](https://qmk.fm) and the exact firmware is [here](https://github.com/MakerJake01/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/makerjake/J46KcolMx).
